# Twitch-Leecher-File-Organizer
Using downloaded videos with the default filename, this tool organizes the videos into subfolders sorted by streamer and stream date. Also downloads an information file about the stream and puts it in the stream's subfolder.

You can create an executable using dart2native (minimum dart version 2.6) and drag mp4 files into the executable.
